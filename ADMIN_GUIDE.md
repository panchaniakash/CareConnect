## Security Best Practices

### User Management Security
1. **Regular Audits**: Review user accounts quarterly
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign minimum necessary permissions
3. **Deactivate Unused Accounts**: Remove access for departed staff
4. **Strong Passwords**: Enforce password complexity requirements
5. **Role Segregation**: Separate administrative and operational roles

### Access Control
1. **Review Permissions Regularly**: Audit role assignments monthly
2. **Monitor System Logs**: Check for unusual authentication patterns
3. **Limit Admin Access**: Minimize number of admin-level users
4. **Session Management**: Users are automatically logged out after token expiration

### Data Protection
1. **Patient Data**: All patient information is encrypted and access-controlled
2. **Audit Trail**: All admin actions are logged
3. **Backup Verification**: Ensure regular database backups
4. **Access Logging**: Monitor who accesses what data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Cannot Access Admin Console
- Verify user has `admin.view_console` permission
- Check if user account is active
- Confirm valid authentication token

#### User Cannot Perform Action
- Check user's role permissions
- Verify the specific permission exists for the action
- Ensure user account is active
